summary: This program is used to run the rpm command on remote machines.

Do you need to check, remove, or update rpm packages on hundreds of Linux machines?
This program can be used to do just that. It runs the rpm command remotely via ssh.
It requires the paramiko and Crypto packages to be installed.
Only Linux is supported at this time.

Disclaimer: This code is untested and was never put into production. Use at your own risk. 
Also, I had to make some modifications recently and no longer have a Linux environment to test, so expect 
some minor typos, etc.
